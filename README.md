# DSA Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based interactive tool for visualizing data structures and algorithms, built to help students understand sorting algorithms through real-time animations. It will likely be unimpressive at first but I plan to learn and develop skills that will change that. I will prioritize front-end at first then expand from there. 

## Project Overview

This project will provide a step-by-step visual representations of popular sorting algorithms, allowing users to see exactly how each algorithm processes data. Perfect for computer science students, tutors, and anyone learning algorithmic concepts.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - Frontend framework for component-based UI
- **JavaScript** - Core programming language with modern syntax
- **Tailwind CSS** - CSS framework for styling
- **Vite** - Modern build tool and development server
- **HTML5 & CSS3** - Web standards for structure and styling
