# DSA Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based interactive tool for visualizing data structures and algorithms, built to help students understand sorting algorithms through real-time animations. It will likely be unimpressive at first but I plan to learn and develop skills that will change that. I will prioritize front-end at first then expand from there. 

## Project Overview

This project provides step-by-step visual representations of popular sorting algorithms, allowing users to see exactly how each algorithm processes data. Perfect for computer science students, tutors, and anyone learning algorithmic concepts.

## Current Features

- Interactive array visualization with animated bars
- Real-time algorithm step visualization
- Customizable animation speed
- User input validation for custom arrays
- Responsive design for all devices

## Technologies Used

- **React** - Frontend framework for component-based UI
- **JavaScript** - Core programming language with modern syntax
- **Tailwind CSS** - CSS framework for styling
- **Vite** - Modern build tool and development server
- **HTML5 & CSS3** - Web standards for structure and styling

## Planned Features

- **Data Structures:**
  - Binary Search Trees
  - Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)

- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort (in progress)
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort

- **Search Algorithms:**
  - Binary Search
  - Linear Search

- **Enhanced Features:**
  - Algorithm comparison mode
  - Performance statistics
  - Save/load custom arrays
  - Algorithm complexity analysis
  - Step-by-step code walkthrough

## Development Tools

- **Git & GitHub** - Version control and project hosting
- **npm** - Package management
- **VS Code** - Development environment
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment for tooling

## Project Goals

- **Educational:** Help students visualize and understand algorithms
- **Interactive:** Provide hands-on learning experience
- **Accessible:** Clean, intuitive interface for all skill levels
- **Comprehensive:** Cover major DSA topics taught in computer science courses
- **Mastery:** Master DSA through programming a visualizer
